## Description:
The objective of this program is to create a solution to a problem a family friend of mine has.


## Problem:
This person (for anonymity sake lets call him Josh) Josh has a big library in his house (around 200 books), and it has become increasingly hard for him to find the books that he is looking for due to Parkinson desease.


## Solution:
After talking to him and hearing the problem we have found a solution that could work. This is to create a software to track the books and where they are located within the library.
This software to make it easier for him to use will be a website.
